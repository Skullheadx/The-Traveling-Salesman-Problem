TSP Problem Definition
If a salesman starts at a town and wants to travel to every other town only once, what is the shortest path he should take?

Assuming that:
1. Each town is connected by a direct edge
2. The distance between town A and town B is the same as the distance between town B and town A
3. The direct path to a town is always the shortest, i.e. going directly from town A to town C is faster than going from town A to town B and then town C
